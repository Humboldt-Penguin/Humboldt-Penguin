Hello!

I'm a third-year undergraduate at Rutgers University studying Physics and Computer Science. My primary research interest is Martian paleomagnetism and impact processes. I also like rock climbing :)

My [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fRvMdfRPxHcCs7aNwoofUByy28Nm1rfO/view?usp=sharing) (last updated April 2023, currently out of date).

Here are summaries/links to my repositories:

## 1. Software

[RedPlanet](https://github.com/Humboldt-Penguin/redplanet) (under heavy development / complete rewrite, reach out if you need a certain feature) — RedPlanet is a Python package for working with various Mars datasets. Examples are GRS for heat flow/depth calculations, 200m topography (parallel/chunked processing for lower system-strain), various crustal thickness models (parameterized by north/south density, various reference interior models, and thickness at InSight), programmatically searchable crater databases, and MAVEN magnetometer data.

## 2. Research

[Mars Geophysics](https://github.com/Humboldt-Penguin/Mars-Magnetics-Research) — *Rutgers Dept. Planetary Sciences*

- Investigating the depth/formation/timing of crustal magnetic sources and implications for history of the Martian dynamo via impact craters. Mentored by Professor Lujendra Ojha.

[High Energy Physics, Muon Scattering](https://github.com/Humboldt-Penguin/HapPyCal) — *Rutgers Dept. Physics/Astronomy*

- Performing analysis/software development for the MUon Scattering Experiment (MUSE) group to investigate the proton radius puzzle. My primary contribution was developing a fast calorimeter simulation framework with Generative Adversarial Networks. Mentored by Professor Ronald Gilman. 
   
   
[Atmospheric/Solar Physics](https://github.com/Humboldt-Penguin/Albedo-Hurricane-Research) — *NJIT Dept. Solar Physics*

- Analyzed cloud-radiation feedback systems during hurricanes with new BBSO Earthshine solar reflectance data. Mentored by Professor Andrew Gerrard.
