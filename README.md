Hello!

I'm a fourth-year undergraduate at Rutgers University studying Physics and Computer Science. My primary research interest is Martian paleomagnetism and impact processes. I also like rock climbing :)

- My [resume](https://files.catbox.moe/k5bgu1.pdf) (last updated February 2025).
- My [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fRvMdfRPxHcCs7aNwoofUByy28Nm1rfO/view?usp=sharing) (last updated April 2023, very out of date).

Here are summaries/links to my repositories:

## 1. Software

[RedPlanet](https://github.com/Humboldt-Penguin/redplanet) — A Python package which provides accessible, easy-to-use, and out-of-the-box tools for working with various Mars geophysical datasets. Examples include:
- Crustal heat flow & Curie depth calculations from gamma-ray spectroscopy (GRS) data.
- Digital elevation models up to 200m resolution, with parallelization/chunking for high-performance.
- Crater database which unifies [1] Robbins & Hynek 2020 database of craters D>=1km, [2] Robbins, Hynek, Lillis, & Bottke 2013 age-modeled craters via isochron-fitting, and [3] official IAU crater names/nomenclature up-to-date.
- Custom crustal thickness models based on Weiczorek's "InSight Crustal Thickness Archive" (~23K options parameterized by any north/south crustal density, 16 reference interior models, and any crustal thickness at InSight)
- MAVEN magnetometer data, filtered for nighttime and low-altitude (COMING SOON).

Expected v1 release in January 2025 or earlier.

## 2. Research

[Mars Geophysics](https://github.com/Humboldt-Penguin/Mars-Magnetics-Research) — *Rutgers Dept. Planetary Sciences*

- Investigating the depth/formation/timing of crustal magnetic sources and implications for history of the Martian dynamo via impact craters. Mentored by Professor Lujendra Ojha.

[High Energy Physics, Muon Scattering](https://github.com/Humboldt-Penguin/HapPyCal) — *Rutgers Dept. Physics/Astronomy*

- Performing analysis/software development for the MUon Scattering Experiment (MUSE) group to investigate the proton radius puzzle. My primary contribution was developing a fast calorimeter simulation framework with Generative Adversarial Networks. Mentored by Professor Ronald Gilman. 
   
   
[Atmospheric/Solar Physics](https://github.com/Humboldt-Penguin/Albedo-Hurricane-Research) — *NJIT Dept. Solar Physics*

- Analyzed cloud-radiation feedback systems during hurricanes with new BBSO Earthshine solar reflectance data. Mentored by Professor Andrew Gerrard.
