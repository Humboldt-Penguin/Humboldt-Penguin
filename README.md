Hello!

I'm a fourth-year undergraduate at Rutgers University studying Physics and Computer Science. My primary research interest is Martian paleomagnetism and impact processes. I also like rock climbing :)

- My [resume](https://files.catbox.moe/nkb2qe.pdf) (last updated February 2025).
- My [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fRvMdfRPxHcCs7aNwoofUByy28Nm1rfO/view?usp=sharing) (last updated April 2023, very out of date).

Here are summaries/links to my repositories:

## 1. Software

[RedPlanet](https://github.com/Humboldt-Penguin/redplanet) ([website](https://humboldt-penguin.github.io/redplanet/)) — an open-source Python library for working with various Mars geophysical datasets. We aim to streamline data analysis/visualization workflows for beginners and experts alike, so you spend less time hunting/wrangling data and more time doing cool science! _KEY FEATURES:_

- **Crater database** which unifies [1] comprehensive database of craters D>=1km, [2] crater ages from both Hartmann and Neukum isochron-fitting, and [3] official/up-to-date IAU crater names.
- **Digital elevation models** up to 200m resolution with memory-mapping, parallelization, and chunking for high-performance.
- **Mohorovičić discontinuity** (crust-mantle interface) models and derived **crustal thickness** maps — models are parameterized by north/south crustal density, reference interior models, and crustal thickness beneath the InSight lander with a total of ~20,000 valid combinations.
- **Magnetic source depth** data from spherical harmonic inversions.
- **Heat flow** and **Curie depth** calculations from **gamma-ray spectroscopy (GRS)** data.
- MAVEN magnetometer data, filtered for nighttime and low-altitude (COMING SOON).

The website/demo should be done by April 2025, but the package is available for install right away and the API is stable with new features coming out regularly!

## 2. Research

[Mars Geophysics](https://github.com/Humboldt-Penguin/Mars-Magnetics-Research) — *Rutgers Dept. Planetary Sciences*

- Investigating the depth/formation/timing of crustal magnetic sources and implications for history of the Martian dynamo via impact craters. Advised by Professor Lujendra Ojha.

[Offshore Wind Farms](https://github.com/Humboldt-Penguin/wind_research) — *NJ Economic Development Authority*

- Fellowship studying offshore wind farms with Synthetic-Aperture Radar (SAR) data from Sentinel-1 satellites. Advised by Professor Roger Wang. 

[High Energy Physics, Muon Scattering](https://github.com/Humboldt-Penguin/HapPyCal) — *Rutgers Dept. Physics/Astronomy + Paul Scherrer Institute*

- Performing analysis/software development for the MUon Scattering Experiment (MUSE) group to investigate the proton radius puzzle. My primary contribution was developing a fast calorimeter simulation framework with Generative Adversarial Networks. Advised by Professor Ronald Gilman. 
   
[Atmospheric/Solar Physics](https://github.com/Humboldt-Penguin/Albedo-Hurricane-Research) — *NJIT Dept. Solar Physics*

- Analyzed cloud-radiation feedback systems during hurricanes with new BBSO Earthshine solar reflectance data. Advised by Professor Andrew Gerrard.
