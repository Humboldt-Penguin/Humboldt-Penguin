Hello!

I'm a second-year undergraduate at Rutgers University studying Physics and Computer Science. My primary research interest is Martian paleomagnetism and impact processes. I also like rock climbing :)

## Research

[Mars Geomagnetism](https://github.com/Humboldt-Penguin/Mars-Magnetics-Research) — *Rutgers Dept. Planetary Sciences*

- Investigating the depth/formation/timing of crustal magnetic sources and implications for history of the Martian dynamo via impact craters. Mentored by Professor Lujendra Ojha.

[High Energy Particle Physics](https://github.com/Humboldt-Penguin/HapPyCal) — *Rutgers Dept. Physics/Astronomy*

- Performing analysis/software development for the MUon Scattering Experiment (MUSE) group to investigate the proton radius puzzle. Primarly contribution was developing a fast calorimeter simulation framework with Generative Adversarial Networks. Mentored by Professor Ronald Gilman. 
   
   
[Atmospheric/Solar Physics](https://github.com/Humboldt-Penguin/Albedo-Hurricane-Research) — *NJIT Dept. Solar Physics*

- Analyzed cloud-radiation feedback systems during hurricanes with new BBSO Earthshine solar reflectance data. Mentored by Professor Andrew Gerrard.
