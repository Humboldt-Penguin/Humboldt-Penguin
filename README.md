Hello!

I'm a third-year undergraduate at Rutgers University studying Physics and Computer Science. My primary research interest is Martian paleomagnetism and impact processes. I also like rock climbing :)

My [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fRvMdfRPxHcCs7aNwoofUByy28Nm1rfO/view?usp=sharing) (last updated April 2023, currently out of date).

Here are summaries/links to my repositories:

## 1. Software

[RedPlanet](https://github.com/Humboldt-Penguin/redplanet) (under heavy development / complete rewrite / data migration; but I'd be happy to help if you need a certain feature) — RedPlanet is a Python package created with the goal of making a handful of Mars geophysical datasets/analyses as accessible and convenient as possible, so you don't have to waste time finding/downloading/formatting data. Examples are heat flow/depth calculations with gamma-ray spectroscopy (GRS) data, digital elevation models up to 200m resolution (with parallelization/chunking to significantly half memory/storage use and increase accessing speed by 3-10 orders of magnitude), custom crustal thickness models (~23K options parameterized by any north/south crustal density, 16 reference interior models, and any crustal thickness at InSight), searchable crater databases, and MAVEN magnetometer data.

## 2. Research

[Mars Geophysics](https://github.com/Humboldt-Penguin/Mars-Magnetics-Research) — *Rutgers Dept. Planetary Sciences*

- Investigating the depth/formation/timing of crustal magnetic sources and implications for history of the Martian dynamo via impact craters. Mentored by Professor Lujendra Ojha.

[High Energy Physics, Muon Scattering](https://github.com/Humboldt-Penguin/HapPyCal) — *Rutgers Dept. Physics/Astronomy*

- Performing analysis/software development for the MUon Scattering Experiment (MUSE) group to investigate the proton radius puzzle. My primary contribution was developing a fast calorimeter simulation framework with Generative Adversarial Networks. Mentored by Professor Ronald Gilman. 
   
   
[Atmospheric/Solar Physics](https://github.com/Humboldt-Penguin/Albedo-Hurricane-Research) — *NJIT Dept. Solar Physics*

- Analyzed cloud-radiation feedback systems during hurricanes with new BBSO Earthshine solar reflectance data. Mentored by Professor Andrew Gerrard.

## 3. Independent Projects

[Physics Simulations with VPython](https://github.com/Humboldt-Penguin/Physics_Simulations)
- Interactive simulations of the N-body problem, Rutherford scattering, magnetic vector fields, etc.

[Space Science with SPICE](https://github.com/Humboldt-Penguin/Space-Science-with-SPICE)
- Analyzing Solar System orbits using NASA’s SPICE library.

[Searching for Exoplanets with Lightkurve](https://github.com/Humboldt-Penguin/Lightkurve-Exoplanets)
- Analyzing Kepler/TESS time series data for star brightness in search of transits.

[Asteroid Spectra Classification with Machine Learning](https://github.com/Humboldt-Penguin/Asteroid-Spectra-Classification-with-Machine-Learning)
- Training multi-class Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to classify asteroid spectra.

[Integrated Water Hardness Meter](https://github.com/Humboldt-Penguin/Integrated_Water_Hardness_Monitor)
